Before I start at the very quick announcement, if you bought anything at the
wonderful pyladies auction last night, you need to pick it up at registration
during the break right now. I've already picked my tie up. Thank you.  So hi.
Good morning. I'm I'm Jacob Kaplan Moss. I'm one of the contributors to Django
and I'm the director of security at Heroku and when I say thank you. I really
mean it is hard for you to run.
